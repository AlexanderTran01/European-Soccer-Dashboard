# The Dashboard

# Data and Methods
The database I used contains information on soccer in Europe and can be found on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hugomathien/soccer.

SQL was used to query the database and retrieve relevant columns, which were then cleaned and loaded into Tableau for visualization.

# Next Steps
I plan to use FIFA's API to obtain more complete and more recent data, which would improve the overall quality and relevance of the project. I also plan to introduce more pages to the dashboard, displaying other interesting metrics.

In addition, I want to utilize various machine learning techniques to predict the outcomes of matches.
